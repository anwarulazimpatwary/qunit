This is the very first stab at getting qunit to work in Titanium.

The qunit.js file has been patched so most tests run. However, one test is failing even though there does not seem to be a problem.

The great thing is that this supports asynch tests, though I haven't done too much yet with it.

Install
=======
Place runner.js in your Resources directory.

Place qunit.js and titanium_adaptor.js in Resources/qunit

Place tests_to_run.js, test.js and same.js in the Resources/test directory. You will modify this tests_to_run.js to include your tests.

Add the app.js_snippet to your app.js (assuming you are using tabGroups, otherwise you will have to find another way).

For mocking, I've tested jsMockito support. Follow the instructions to install jsMockito (http://chrisleishman.github.com/jsmockito/) and uncomment the lines in titanium_adaptor.js (correcting the subdirectories, etc. on the way).
